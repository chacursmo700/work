			<p>I'm a life long learner and I have many learning goals. I like to follow the school year so I am currently completing my summer reading and preparing for the fall semester. This fall I've enrolled in edX's Probability course and I am also studying Calculus. I've collected a fairly substantial portion of textbooks and the broad outline is a good grounding in mathematics: Calculus, Probability, and Linear Algebra. I also have some graduate level books on each subject: Analysis, Mathematical Statistics, and Applications on Linear Algebra. I plan to read the Feynman Lectures for a sound basis in physics. I have a text book on Algorithms and Machine Learning. Also a textbook on Logic. In another vein of thought I have a series of textbooks on business. From economics to accounting, some business law, financial markets and retail management. The question is what am I going to do with all this learning? I feel that wise people seek knowledge. I have primarily studied history previously and this is simply how I work. I study and apply. Through my extensive reading of biographies I have found certain life decisions to not be in my best interest. Be humble be happy. Don't shoot for the moon or you might get shot. e.g. John F. Kennedy.</p>
